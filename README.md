## Shine
Shine is a web-based dashboard for indie Mac developers. It's designed to manage payment and order processing with PayPal and generate and email license files to your users using the [Aquatic Prime](http://www.aquaticmac.com/) framework. It even uploads each revision of your app into Amazon S3 and can produce reports from your users' demographic info (gathered via [Sparkle](http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/)). It also serves as a central location to collect user feedback, bug reports, and support questions using the [OpenFeedback framework](http://github.com/tylerhall/OpenFeedback/tree/master).
